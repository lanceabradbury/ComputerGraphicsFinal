# ComputerGraphicsFinal
Final Project for my computer graphics class

I made a little game for my final project in computer graphics. Standard wasd movement, only a few small rooms. I have not included any of the textures I used because they were pulled from the internet and I don't have any rights to them.

There are a few small bugs still.
